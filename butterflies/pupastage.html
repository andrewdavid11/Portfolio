    <h3>Transformation takes time, patience, and a little luck.</h3>
    <article>
      <p class="maintext">A full caterpillar becomes a wanderer.  He looks all about him for a good place to build a home.
        What makes a good spot?  Shelter from predators, elements, and a sturdy branch to hang from are the primary goals.  
        The caterpillar, having found just the ideal spot, will anchor himself to a branch and hang down, then build a pupa,
        or chrysalis about himself.<br />This stage, like the egg stage, appears from the outside to be a period of rest, but inside,
        a rapid metamorphosis is taking place.  Wings are forming, and the body of the caterpillar becomes smaller and lighter.
        All those leaves the caterpillar gobbled up are being put to good use.<br/ >Some pupa can move, but most cannot.  That is why
        a caterpillar thinks so long about location, location location!  Many insects, snakes, frogs, and other animals will eat up
        a chrysalis they come across, so inside, the growing butterfly has much to worry about besides growing.
