      <p class="maintext">When an egg hatches, what emerges is a larva, more commonly known as a caterpillar.  A caterpillar never meets its parents
        and must rely entirely on instinct to know what to do.  The caterpillar 
        is an interesting creature in its own right with lots of legs, and a long body.  But caterpillars do not lead very
        interesting lives.  Their sole focus is on becoming a butterfly one day.  Think of the caterpillar as a little kid
        with a dream.  To advance that dream, the caterpillar eats...A LOT.  Pretty much all day, every day.<br />The first meal 
        for a caterpillar is the leaf their egg was laid on.  For this reason, a mother butterfly is very careful in what leaf
        she chooses for her eggs. Each kind of butterfly chooses different kinds of leaves.  We would give you more detail,
        but there are more than 18,000 varities of butterflies!<br />Caterpillars only eat leaves, and they do little more than eat them.
        When a caterpillar has grown big and strong enough, they are ready for the third stage in the life cycle.

      <p class="maintext">Caterpillars hardly all look alike.  While their bodies tend to be long and soft, they can come in many colors, patterns,
        sizes, shapes, have fur, spikes, eyespots or other defense mechanisms.</p>
