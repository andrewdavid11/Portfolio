      <p class="maintext">The first stage in a butterfly's life cycle is the egg.  Butterfly eggs are laid on leaves, and are very tiny.  
      They can be round, oval, or even other shapes.  Most butterfly eggs are soft.  The shape depends on the type of butterfly, and so too does the kind of leaf
      the eggs are laid on.  A single butterfly does not lay just one egg, but many.  The time for an egg to hatch depends on many factors
      including weather and season.  A butterfly egg will not hatch when the air is cold, so an egg laid in late fall may lay dormant
      until spring.</p>
      <p>The egg cycle is not a seemingly active one.  The egg does not have to do anything, but inside the larva is growing.  What will emerge?  Move on to the next stage with the link below to find out.</p>
