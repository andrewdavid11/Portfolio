		<h1>Flight of the Butterflies</h1>

		  <p class="maintext">Flight is never easy to achieve.  But what evolution produced over millenia, and man discovered over centuries, the butterfly has only a few hours to learn.  
			 After a brief rest, the freshly-hatched adult butterfly needs to get airborne.  For one, there is the constant need for nectar.  
			 For another, a stationary butterfly is a very vulnerable one, and one soon to be a frog or snake's meal.
		  </p>
		  <p>Butterflies have four wings, though to the naked eye they appear as only two.  When studied in wind tunnels, the flight of butterflies
			 has been broken down into about a dozen different aerodynamic methods to generate the force needed to fly and change directions.  
			 What is more, butterflies use these methods interchangeably and often together.

		<h2>Migration</h2>
		<article>
		   <p class="maintext">While the flight of butterflies might appear slow and haphazard, some butterfly species routinely migrate up to thousands of miles seasonally.
			  As the weather turns, they will head south for the winter, only to return in spring.  Of course, since the life cycle of butterflies is commonly
			  under one month in total, this means the butterflies who return in spring are not the same ones who left in fall, but often the "grandchildren".
			  They are "returning" to a place they have never themselves been.  Now that is instinct at work.  One notable migration is the Monarch Butterfly,
			  which travels up to 4800 kilometers, or 3000 miles, each year between Mexico and southern Canada.  Butterflies navigate using their antennae, eyes,
			  and polarized light, and though they fly almost exclusively in the daytime, they can navigate just fine on cloudy days and even inside clouds.
