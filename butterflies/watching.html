    <h2>Watching Butterflies</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="maintext'>Anyplace there are flowers, and or fruit trees, you are likely to spot butterflies.  This can be in the wild, your backyard,
             or any of a number of ever-growing butterfly houses, farms, or sanctuaries.  As butterfly habitats shrink, and many species
             become threatened or endangered, groups are forming to protect natural diversity and celebrate some of the splendors of the 
             insect world.  Zoos too are adding "butterfly pavilions".  There is one in Allen, TX, another in Albuquerque, NM, and one in Denver, CO.<br />
             There are many options for butterfly vacations as well, including visits to Bed and Breakfasts, or migration sites for butterflies.  
             Use a search engine or call your travel agent for more information.
          </p>
          <p class="maintext">Butterflies are cold-blooded and so require warm climates.  You can find them year-round in the tropics, and areas around the equators,
             but only seasonally in most other areas.  Summer is the safest bet as spring can come late in a given year, and autumn may arrive early.
             Butterflies alive when the weather changes will go into hibernation, and eggs will wait to hatch until the air is warm enough, just as
             we all like to stay in a warm bed on a cold morning.
             The following table shows sightings by season for monarch butterflies in North America by latitude:

    <h2>Attracting Butterflies</h2>
       <article>
       <p class="maintext">Want butterflies to come to you?  Many people landscape and garden with a mind not just to putting in beautiful flowers but to attracting
            birds and butterflies.  Just as you would put in a bird-feeder with birdseed to draw out cardinals and bluejays, if you want butterflies,
            you need their food source: nectar and fruit juice.  Yes, there are certain flowers most likely to attract butterflies.  This can be as simple
            as adding a good variety of flowers and testing what works and what doesn't from one year to the next, or you can make a real science of it.
            The following two links will take you to webpages focused entirely on optimizing your garden for butterflies.  You can target a wide
            variety of species, or run a search by your favorite target species of butterfly.

    <h2>Photographing Butterflies</h2>
       <article>
       <ul class="maintext">
          <li>Butterflies are frightened by motion and noise, so if you want to get good pictures of butterflies, you will need to stay very <span class="bold">still</span> and <span class="bold">quiet</span>.</li>
          <li>A camera with a good <span class="bold"zoom</span>, and a <span class="bold">"microzoom"</span> feature to capture small objects while reducing blurriness, will be a priceless accessory.</li>
          <li>Try to plan before you plan to shoot.  Get familiar with the area, if you are not already, and factor in the sun and shadows before you settle in.</li>
          <li>Take a lot of shots.  Not all of what you shoot will come out as you hope, so the best protection against missed opportunity is to keep the shutters clicking.  This easier and more affordable than ever with digital cameras.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Be natural.</span>  This doesn't mean going out in your birthday suit, but you may want to try to limit cosmetics such as deodorant and hairspray and perfume which will mask the scent of nectar flowers are trying to project.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Smell sweet.</span>  You can also try rubbing yourself with a little nectar or fruit juice to blend in and draw curious hungry butterflies even closer, but beware of drawing bees instead!</li>

    <h2>Raising Butterflies</h2>
       <article>
         <p class="maintext">Some teachers and parents help their children raise butterfly colonies.  Commercial kits and products are available, and eggs can be ordered, or found in the wilderness.
            Then conditions are set to optimize the environment for the butterflies, plenty of food is provided for newly-hatched caterpillars, and the butterflies can be witnessed
            breaking out of their pupas.  Just remember to let the butteflies go so they can live a full life in the wild, mate, and leave more eggs behind.
