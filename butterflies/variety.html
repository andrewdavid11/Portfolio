    <h2>Many Species</h2>
    <article>
      <p class="maintext">While not every caterpillar looks alike, the real variations in butterflies come out in the adult stage.
        There are over 18,000 species of butterflies in the world.  There are so many butterfly species, no one can be 
        certain how many there are exactly.  Many species are rare, with narrow habitats, often hard to reach, and other factors contribute
        to the difficulty in counting butterflies precisely.</p>
        <p>Butterflies can have short life spans, often less than one month total, may not 
        appear every season, and can show seasonal variations and other forms of polymorphism.  Some species have several varieties of female
        butterflies, and some others differ from one geographic region to another.</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder, that it can even be hard to be sure if a butterfly is just
        a bold member of a known species, or is a member of a newly discovered one!</p>
        <p>There are some famous and common varieties of butterfly however,
        commonly identified and sought after by naturalists, hunters, and classes of schoolchildren.  Some are listed below, with their
        english name, and scientific notation:

    <h2>Mimicry</h2>

    <article>
      <p class="maintext">Within and between species there is a great prevalance for mimicry.  This means some butterflies copy each other, or even other animals.
         A common and well-known example of this is "eyespots" near the rear of wings.  These eyespots attempt to mimic the large eyes of larger
         animals, and to make it seem the butterfly is watching.  The effect can scare away predators.  Some butterflies show patterns and wing colors
         which simulate poisonous or less-tasty species, also.  All this camouflage makes putting a butterfly in a category pretty challenging.</p>

    <h2>Gotta catch them all?</h2>
    <article>
      <p class="maintext">There are many organizations in the world for people interested in butterflies.  Butterfly watchers often keep lists to track the species
         they have seen, trying to spot them all.  This can get to be an expensive hobby, involving years, and spanning entire continents,
         but need not start out as anything but a pastime.  Free checklist forms are available on the internet and by contacting these organizations
         the old-fashioned way.  Traditionally, you must spot each species as an adult butterfly, not in any of the other stages.<br />Though,
         if you can tell one butterfly species's eggs from another's, maybe you deserve the sighting!
