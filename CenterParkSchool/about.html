		<h2>All About Center Park School</h2>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Center Park School was founded in 1925 by William Orator Hignatium and his fiancee, Sarah Eliza Doolittle.
		The school was originally a single room and the first teachers were the founders themselves.  Subjects taught were reading, writing and arithmetic.
		Expansion and modernization to the present buildings began shortly after WW2, in 1948, and renovations have taken place
		in 1975 and 2003.  There have been 11 schoolmasters and principals.</p><br />
		<h3>Awards and Accomplishments</h3>
		<p>Center Park School's Debate Team took top honors in the county in 2007,2008,2010, and 2013.  
		Students have won 26 blue ribbons as entrants to the state fair in the past decade.
		The school girls soccer team took the state 3A Junior Elementary Championship in 2012.
		The boys football team won the division title in 2009 and 2013.</p><br />
		<h3>Faculty and Staff</h3>
		<p>The present school principal is <a href="principal.html">Thadeus Swart</a>.</p>
		<p>The present school vice-principal is <a href="vice.html">Susan Artsky</a></p>
		<p>There are <a href="directory.html">49 dedicated teachers</a> working with the children of Center Park School. 
		They come from right here in Hutto, to as far away as Anchorage, AK and Miami, FL, because Center Park is such a great place
		to work, and Hutto is such a great place to live.</p><br />
